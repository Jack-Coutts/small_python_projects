## Simple genetic algorithms moving circles to squares.

Two genetic algorithms for moving a population of circles towards a target square:

- turtle_genetic_algo.py only uses functions and visualises the process using the turtle module.
- genetic_algo_v3.py uses classes to create the population, outputs text summaries. 
- Next step is to add pygame visualisations to genetic_algo_v3.py.
