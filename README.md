# Simple genetic algorithms moving circles to squares.

- Simple algorithm with visualisation using turtle. This works but is far too slow.
- Version 3 is more complex/efficient and uses classes. Functional but circles are not hitting the square. No visualisation.
- Visualisation with pygame would be a good next step.
